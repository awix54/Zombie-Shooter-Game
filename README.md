# Zombie Shooter Game

## Overview

**Zombie Shooter Game** is a game built using **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and the **Phaser** game development framework. In this game, the player must defend against hordes of zombies that spawn randomly from set points on the map. Armed with unlimited ammo, the player must survive by shooting the zombies while managing their health using healing boxes that appear at random intervals.

## Gameplay Features

- **Zombie Waves**: Zombies spawn randomly from designated spawn points and continuously try to overwhelm the player.
- **Unlimited Ammo**: No need to worry about running out of bullets—you can shoot as much as you want.
- **Healing Boxes**: Green boxes appear at random locations on the map, and picking them up restores a portion of your health.

## Objective

Survive as long as possible by shooting down zombies and keeping your health up. Zombies will spawn from fixed points, and you must take them down before they reach you.

## Game Mechanics

1. **Zombie Spawning**: Zombies appear at random intervals from specific spawn points on the map, increasing in difficulty over time.
2. **Unlimited Ammo**: Keep shooting—there’s no need to reload or conserve bullets.
3. **Healing System**: Green healing boxes spawn at random locations on the map. Walking over one restores a portion of your health, so keep an eye out for them.
4. **Survival**: The game ends when your health reaches zero. The longer you survive, the higher your score.
